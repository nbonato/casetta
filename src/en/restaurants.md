There are a few places close to the flat, if you want more information or ask questions about specific places, just contact us through Airbnb.

Always call to reserve a table at sit-down restaurants. 
For pizzerias and more casual dining options that's not necessary.


## üçù Sit-down restaurants

- **Osteria Borgoluce**, owned by what used to be the local noble family, which built the castle and still owns farmlands all around. This is a proper restaurant, with lots of local ingredients and mostly Italian/local cuisine
- **Casa Brianzuola**
- **Da Checco al Mazariol**


## üçî Casual dining

- **Frasca Borgoluce**, fancier burger restaurant with mostly local ingredients
- **Barone rosso**, pub with lots of beers, local and not, and pub food (mostly sandwiches)
- **Japan House** (all you can eat sushi)
- **Las tapas de Marcel** (Spanish/tapas)

The last two options are right around the corner, less than 200 meters from the flat.

## üçï Pizzerias

- **Pizza D'Angelo**, closest takeaway pizza
- **Pizzalonga**, takeaway pizza franchise, there is one in Ponte della Priula and one in Conegliano. Parking is easier at the one in Ponte della Priula
- **Il Saraceno** (easy parking, 5 minutes by car from the flat)
- **[Casa della Pasqualina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wVA8vsMXBDKNpv6H9)**
- **Pantarei**

    <summary>Pizzeria - Ristorante</summary>
    Many pizzerias are "Pizzeria - Ristorante", meaning they also offer classic restaurant meals, most often pasta dishes, salads and maybe some meat or fish dishes.

    If you travel to more touristy areas (like most places in Venice), we'd suggest sticking to restaurants, rather than "Pizzeria - Ristorante", unless you've read good reviews.
