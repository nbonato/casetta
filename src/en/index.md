## Welcome to our flat!

This is a guide to our flat in Susegana.
If you are not currently a guest, you can [book a stay on Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/h/susegana).

Everything on this website applies **unless we specifically tell you so through Airbnb chat**. This might happen if we made some changes but haven't had the time to update this guide.

## House rules, check-in and check-out

Check-in is possible from 15:00 to 22:00 (3 PM to 10 PM). We can rarely make exceptions, due to our work hours, but you can always ask.

Check-out should always happen before 12:00 (12 PM or noon), unless we specifically agreed to a different time.

The flat is in a residential building, so we ask you to be considerate of the people living here and avoid loud noises as much as possible, and especially between 22:00 and 8:00 (10 PM to 8 AM).

## Places where to eat and grocery shops

We have longer and more detailed lists on our [restaurants](restaurants) and [shops](shops) pages, but the closest places to the flat are right around the corner and are:

- Las tapas de Marcel
- Japan House

As for grocery shops, you can go to Eurofrutta, which is a few steps from the flat, or IperLando, a large supermarket 10 minutes from the flat on foot, also easily accessible by car.

## Issues and emergencies

For serious emergencies, please **call 112, the European emergency number** which will redirect you to the most appropriate service.

We also have a [page on possible issues you might experience](issues) and solutions to them, but in general you can always contact us directly through Airbnb and we'll do our best to reply as soon as possible.
