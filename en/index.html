    <h1>Guide for guests</h1>
<h2>Welcome to our flat!</h2>
<p>This is a guide to our flat in Susegana.
If you are not currently a guest, you can <a href="https://airbnb.com/h/susegana">book a stay on Airbnb</a>.</p>
<p>Everything on this website applies <strong>unless we specifically tell you so through Airbnb chat</strong>. This might happen if we made some changes but haven't had the time to update this guide.</p>
<h2>House rules, check-in and check-out</h2>
<p>Check-in is possible from 15:00 to 22:00 (3 PM to 10 PM). We can rarely make exceptions, due to our work hours, but you can always ask.</p>
<p>Check-out should always happen before 12:00 (12 PM or noon), unless we specifically agreed to a different time.</p>
<p>The flat is in a residential building, so we ask you to be considerate of the people living here and avoid loud noises as much as possible, and especially between 22:00 and 8:00 (10 PM to 8 AM).</p>
<h2>Places where to eat and grocery shops</h2>
<p>We have longer and more detailed lists on our <a href="restaurants">restaurants</a> and <a href="shops">shops</a> pages, but the closest places to the flat are right around the corner and are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Las tapas de Marcel</li>
<li>Japan House</li>
</ul>
<p>As for grocery shops, you can go to Eurofrutta, which is a few steps from the flat, or IperLando, a large supermarket 10 minutes from the flat on foot, also easily accessible by car.</p>
<h2>Issues and emergencies</h2>
<p>For serious emergencies, please <strong>call 112, the European emergency number</strong> which will redirect you to the most appropriate service.</p>
<p>We also have a <a href="issues">page on possible issues you might experience</a> and solutions to them, but in general you can always contact us directly through Airbnb and we'll do our best to reply as soon as possible.</p>
