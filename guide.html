            <h1 id="instructions-for-the-apartment">Instructions for the apartment</h1>
            <h2 id="rubbish-garbage">üóëÔ∏è Rubbish/Garbage</h2>
            <p>As in most Italian towns, we also have to sort the rubbish in different bins. We have placed all of them under the kitchen sink and labelled them also in English, but in general the different bins are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>yellow for paper and cardboard, included milk cartons or juice boxes</li>
                <li>blue for plastic, tin cans and glass</li>
                <li>compost for all food waste</li>
                <li>black/gray bag for all unsortable waste (please try and keep it to a minimum)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Outside of extraordinary circumstances, you do not need to take out the trash at any point during your stay. If you are close to filling up a bin, just let us know and we will either come and take care of it or give you instructions on where to put it.</p>
            <h2 id="heating">üå°Ô∏è Heating</h2>
            <p>The thermostat right under the AC unit controls the temperature for the whole apartment, so you can set it to whatever you want (in Celsius degrees). We normally leave the house around 20¬∞C since it&#39;s a relatively small space and particularly the bedroom can become too hot otherwise.</p>
            <p>We always try to leave the thermostat already switched on, but if for whatever reason it is switched off (you see no light on it), you can move the little toggle on it to the middle position and it will switch on (green light).</p>


            <h2 id="fridge">üçï Fridge and cupboard</h2>
            <p>Nothing particular about them, this is only to reassure you that everything you find in the fridge or the cupboard can be eaten or drunk, it's there for you!</p>
            <h2 id="extra-towels-or-bedding">üõèÔ∏è Extra towels or bedding</h2>
            <p>If you need another blanket or a new set of sheets, you can find them in the chest of drawers in the bedroom, either in the second or in the last drawer.</p>
            <p>There, you can also find extra towels. If you can, please let us know if you are using any extra beddings or towels, so we know how to schedule the clean-up for the next host.</p>
            
            <h2 id="internet">üõú Internet</h2>
            <p>If you booked through Airbnb, you will be able to see the wi-fi password there. 
            If you have booked through Booking.com, you will receive the password after your check-in the chat you have with us.
            In any case, the network name is Huawei-6FF1.</p>
            
            <h2 id="tv">üì∫ Watching TV</h2>
            <p>The TV is not yet connected to the antenna, so it works with a Google Chromecast. The general Chromecast account is ours, but since many other guests use the TV please note that there might be other logged in accounts to Netflix, Prime Video or even YouTube.</p>
            <p>If you have your own account, you can log to any of the paid streaming services and use the Chromecast with the white remote (this a guide to the Chromecast remote). If you do not have any, you can still watch YouTube, Italian public broadcast (RAI) and one private channel, called La7, through the Google Chromecast.</p>

            <section class="accordion">
                <input type="checkbox" name="collapse2" id="handle3">
                <h2 class="handle">
                  <label for="handle3">Watching Rai and La7</label>
                </h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <h3 id="watching-rai">Watching RAI</h3>
                    <p>RAI is the Italian public broadcast, like BBC for the UK, and it has multiple channels. RaiPlay is its on demand and streaming app, so you can watch both live and past broadcasts. While live broadcasts are almost uniquely in Italian, many foreign films do actually have the original version and sometimes even subtitles in languages different from Italian.</p>
                    <p>To watch RAI you just need to open the RaiPlay app, the logged in account is ours so feel free to use it.</p>
                    <h3 id="watching-la7">Watching La7</h3>
                    <p>La7 is one of Italy&#39;s most commonly watched private channels, it does not have an app but you can watch both on demand and live broadcast through Kodi. </p>
                    <p>The interface is not super user-friendly, but you just need to open the Kodi app then press on La7-La7d which will be shown as the only Favourite channel. </p>
                    <p>If you do not know any Italian it will be a bit hard to figure ou what you can watch, but in all honesty most of it would be in Italian anyway, so it might not be of interest to you in general.</p>
